    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>Free and open source version Control system Basically a tool which helps in track the changes in the code and helps to collborate with other developer  to same project </p>
    <h1>Github</h1>
    <p>Websites where we host repositories online</p>

    <h3>Basic commands</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Clone</b> is repositry in our local machine means making a clone of git hub repositry in our VS code   (git clone 'link of code form github')</li>
        <li><b>add/add .</b> used to add or amke changes in your working directory to the git staging area.(git add file name)/(git add .) this is for to add whole files</li>

        <li><b>commit</b> it is record of change or making status of the file from untracked/modified to staged  or making a stamp for final addition(git commit -m" ") -m and quots is used for add comments for changes but not mandetory <i>in case existing file been modified no left with the untracked file and no new file been created in that case </i> add and commit <i>can be done at one command <b>git commit -am 'Added new data'</b></i></li>

        <li><b>push</b> upload the local repositry content to remote repository means transfer the all changes to the github account/repository (git push origin main)</li>

        <li><b>init</b> to make new git repository in our local system later we can commit in github(git init)make a repositry first and by access to that repositry and initalize the code  <b>INIT basic Commands</b><ul>
            <li>git remote add origin - link-  = basically making remote to where we want to push our repositry</li>
            <li><b>remote -v</b> to verify the  upper remote is  sucessfully made or not</li>
            <li><b>branch</b> to check branch , it is basically the name of the house just like we have in the school developer will create diff branch and other's other name and at last they will combine the whole branch</li>

            <li><b>branch -m customName</b>as the name sugests change the name of the branch for Rename</li>
            <li><b>git push origin main</b> other way to make it short form just write Once this 'git push -u origin main' and Onwards we can use only <b>git push</b></li>
            
            <li><b>checkout -b newBranchName</b> to create new branch</li>
            <li><b>checkout branchName</b> just like switching into the diff accounts we can witch to diff branch to navigate</li>
            <li><b>branch -d branchName</b> to delete any branch by standing outside of that branch</li>

        </ul></li>
        As we had  learned the making of new branches now the new brannches cannot push themselves into the github as the old or mainly with the name of main branches have the acces to the github to do likewise we need to made origin for new branches so that later we can merge and compare the brances( <b><i>git remote set-url origin https:// 'token link'@'repositry https link'</i></b> ) now we can push like normal brances. caution:- if new branches from same repository no needed for that process only to set upstream/adding in the same repository( <b><i>git push --set-upstream origin BranchName</i></b> )
        


    </ul>
